Documents within this tree give details on algorithms that SAFRN1 will
implement.  Regarding implementation progress, :pushpin: indicates
successfully implemented, :paperclip: indicates plans for
implementation, and :scissors: indicates that it has been cut from
implementation plans.  :triangular_ruler: indicates possible implementation in SAFRN 1.1 or later.

 - :paperclip: [Linear
   Regression](./zz-algorithms/Linear-Regression)
   - :paperclip: [F Test](./zz-algorithms/Linear-Regression#F-test)
   - :paperclip: [T Test](./zz-algorithms/Linear-Regression#T-test)
 - :triangular_ruler: [Lasso
   Regression](./zz-algorithms/Lasso-Regression)
 - :triangular_ruler: [Logistic
   Regression](../zz-algorithms/Logistic-Regression) this is a low
   priority/optional requirement.
 - :linked_paperclips: [Moments](./zz-algorithms/Moments) The
   [mean](./zz-algorithms/mean) is implemented in SAFRN0, and we
   are discussing which moments are valuable for SAFRN1.
 - :triangular_ruler: [QR
   Decomposition](./zz-algorithms/QR-Decomposition) This may be a
   component to another algorithm, but on its own adds no value to
   SAFRN.
 - :paperclip: [Ranking](./zz-algorithms/Ranking) we are currently
   discussing which rankings are important (thinking maximum, minimum,
   and median at the moment).
 - :triangular_ruler: [K-Means
   Clustering](./zz-algorithms/k-means-clustering) This is an
   optional requirement.
 - :paperclip: [Matrix
   Inverse](./zz-algorithms/Matrix-Inverse) This may be a component
   to something else. However on its own has no value to SAFRN.
 - :triangular_ruler: [Gradient
   Descent](./zz-algorithms/Gradient-descent) this may be a
   compoment to one of the regressions, otherwise there are no plans
   for this.
 - :scissors: [Maximum Likelihood
   Estimation](./zz-algorithms/Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation)
 - :scissors: [Grubbs Outlier
   Test](./zz-algorithms/Grubbs-Outlier-Test)
 - :scissors: [Chi-Squared Test](./zz-algorithms/Chi-Squared-Test)
 - :scissors: [Dixon's Q Test](./zz-algorithms/Dixons-Q-test)
