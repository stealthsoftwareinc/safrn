# Usage Scenarios

On this page, we describe a few usage scenarios of the dashboard.  Note that these scenarios only highlight the dashboard-relevant portions of the overall system.

# Scenario 1

The Analyst is an appointed entity working with the government toward gathering annual national statistics for student financial information by various school-related categories (major, school, etc).

There are three verticals: schools, wage databases, and loan databases.  Within each vertical, there are 5 schools, 1 wage database, and 2 loan databases.

They all agree to use a SAFRN dashboard that is hosted by Stealth at safrn.stealthsoftwareinc.com

They register with the dashboard, and enroll in an MPC "doodle poll" to agree on roles, and obtain configuration files as part of this interaction.

TODO: Flesh out more of this scenario as needed

# Scenario 2

The Analyst is a medical researcher.

There are two verticals: hospitals and insurance companies.
