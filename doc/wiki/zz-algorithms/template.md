# Algorithm Template
Describe the algorithm briefly.
Make sure to touch on its usage and purpose.

## Inputs and outputs
List each of the inputs and then the outputs.
Make sure to include the meaning and type of each input or output.

 - **input/output name** (in/out: _datatype_) description

## Cleartext Algorithm
Provide details of the algorithm as it is performed in cleartext.
This can include equations or pseudocode.
If necessary add an example as well.

## Secure Implementation
 - PSI Requirements: (PSI-Function, vector of sub-intersections, or full intersection? in order?)
 - Randomness Requirements: (random OTs, or some form of correlated random vectors, etc?)

Describe the secure implementation of the algorithm.

## Implementation Status
Note, this status should refer only to SAFRN1.
If development of this algorithm is not currently in progress, link to a gitlab issue tracking it.
Otherwise, note whether it is implemented or not.
